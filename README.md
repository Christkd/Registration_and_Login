Registration and Login form page.

*This is a small project and practice of HTML + Bootstrap + Python + MySQL + Flask + Flask-bcrypt, it is of personal use only, to showcase and track my progress as an independent developer.*

- On this project, I created and designed a Registration and Login form. It can be used for websites, social medias, blogs, etc.
  
- Flask-bcrypt is included for passwords. Bcrypt is a cryptographic hash function designed for password hashing and safe storing in the backend of applications in a way that is less susceptible to dictionary-based cyberattacks.


- Below are screenshots of the front end.
